It looks like you're interested in the topic of **Car Loan Calculators**. A car loan calculator helps users determine monthly payments for a car loan based on key factors such as loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and down payment. These calculators are useful for prospective car buyers to understand their financial commitment before taking out a loan.

Here's how a **CARSLOANCALCULATOR.COM.AU** typically works:

### Inputs:
1. **Loan Amount** – The amount of money you borrow from the bank or financial institution.
2. **Interest Rate** – The percentage rate charged by the lender for borrowing money.
3. **Loan Term** – The duration (usually in months or years) over which the loan will be repaid.
4. **Down Payment** – The initial amount you pay upfront when purchasing the car.
5. **Sales Tax** – Sometimes included to calculate the total cost of the car with taxes.

### Outputs:
1. **Monthly Payment** – The amount you need to pay each month towards your car loan.
2. **Total Loan Repayment** – The total amount you will pay over the entire loan period (including interest).
3. **Total Interest Paid** – The total amount of interest you'll end up paying over the course of the loan.

### Formula for Car Loan Calculator:
The monthly payment can be calculated using the formula for an amortizing loan:

\[
M = \frac{P \times r \times (1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- \(M\) = Monthly payment
- \(P\) = Loan amount
- \(r\) = Monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)
- \(n\) = Total number of payments (loan term in months)
